## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Better using css grid for templating.

I use `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` for ordering cards. Maybe easier solution would be add extra `div` wrapper for second and third card's for better manipulation in css. I choose this solution because I want better understand of templating with grid.

### Continued development

Training more grid templating.
